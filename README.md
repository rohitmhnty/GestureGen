conda activate gesturelsm
conda install pytorch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 torchaudio==2.1.2 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash demo/install_mfa.sh
```

## Results

![Beat Results](beat-new.png)

This table shows the results of 1-speaker and all-speaker comparisons. RAG-Gesture refers to [**Retrieving Semantics from the Deep: an RAG Solution for Gesture Synthesis**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06786), accepted by CVPR 2025.

## Note
- The statistics reported in the paper is based on 1-speaker with speaker-id of 2, 'scott' in order to be consistent with the previous SOTA methods.
- The pretrained model previously provided is trained on 1-speaker. (RVQ-VAEs, Diffusion, Shortcut, Shortcut-reflow)
- If you want to use all-speaker, please modify the config files to include all speaker ids.
- April 16, 2025: update the pretrained model to include all speakers. (RVQ-VAEs, Shortcut)
- I did not do hyperparameter tuning for all-speaker, but just use the same setting as 1-speaker.
- You can add the speaker embedding if you want to have a better performance for all-speakers. I did not add it to make the code more aligned with the current 1-speaker setting and make the model capable of generating gesture for a novel speaker.
- No gesture type information is used in the current version. The reason is that for a novel speaker and novel setting, you never know the gesture type. As a result, including this information is not realistic for real-world applications. However, if you just want to see a even better FGD, you can try to add this information.
